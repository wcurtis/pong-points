# NOTE: Explicitly NOT putting production / staging data in this file. This data
# lives instead on the actual servers. Capistrano is configured to copy a ~/database.yml
# into the config directory, over-writing the one in Git. This means the connection data
# lives on the server and nowwhere else.
